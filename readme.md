As a company we would like to have a way of mailing each other internally. Its a known fact that GMail, YahooMail and Hotmail have arent secure. We would also like to make this a SPA(Single Page App).

## Deliverables

1. User should be able to compose email and send to registered email accounts in the app.
1. User Should be able to view mails in inbox without reloading the page. Real time changes arent needed.
1. User should be able to view sent items and archive mails.
